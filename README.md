# pytorch-superpixels
A way to use superpixels at run-time with Pytorch

This project stems from a module I created for use in my master's thesis.

With some work I think it could be useful for others that wish to utilise superpixels in their Pytorch Machine learning projects.

Ideally I would like to add support for many of the more popular datasets, publish a pypi package and maybe even port this to TensorFlow.

Currently the code is fragmented and unusable, with community support I hope to change that soon.
